At Present, we can scrape SEP directly and IEP using google search api. Howevever, we are limited to 100
transactions per day with google api, meaning we will probably have to do sentence-level searches instead
of keyword searches. Of course, one benefit is that we will reduce the number of requests and reduce 
response time. We may also limit irrelevant results based on unimportant non-stopwords.
