/**
 * The strategy for crawling the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) has
 * two phases:
 *
 * PHASE 1:
 * Send a request to the SEP search endpoint for each unique keyword. Each request
 * will return the top ten suggested articles for that keyword. Those ten suggestions
 * are then cached in a sorted set in Redis.
 *
 * PHASE 2:
 * After all the keywords have been queried against the SEP search endpoint, the top
 * urls need to be scraped to gather content for recommendation cards.
 *
 * The current implementatino is not performant, as each request must wait for the one
 * before it to complete.
 *
 * The current implementation is so unperformant that it is not viable.
 * A user could have to wait an excuriating 30 seconds or more to recieve recommendations.
 * Caching will help, but we need to perform more aysnc operations in parallel and await
 * multiple promises. We could also have an in-house
 * Optimizations: (1) unix sockets,
 *                (2) await multiple promises,
 *                (3) caching top keyword urls
